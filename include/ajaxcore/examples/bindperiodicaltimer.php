This is a simple test file to check out the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ajaxcore/">AjaxCore</a> framework. <br />
When the button is pressed,a <b>Timer</b> starts with the milliseconds specified on the bindPeriodicalTimer call, and when it get to zero, an AJAX request is being made to return a random number. 
<br />
<br /> After the AJAX request is made, the timer starts all over again.
<br />

<center>
	<input type="button" id="mybutton" name="mybutton" value="press me!">
	<? echo $ajax->bindPeriodicalTimer("mybutton","onclick","getRandomNumber","mytimer","5000"); /* Bind a PeriodicalTimer to an HTML object to an JavaScript event to call PHP function */ ?>
	<div id="results" name="results" >  <!-- div where results will be placed -->
	</div>
</center>
Have fun!	 <br />
